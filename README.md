## YouList 📺 📝

Being an avid Youtube fan, I HAD to build a project using the <b>youtube-data-api</b>. Youtube is my first destination when it comes to learning new stuff 😉 and is my go to destination
for seeking inspiration from other tech, lifestyle, travel youtube creators.

### Why I built this?
I learn alot from Youtube but often lose track of the videos(the videos I haven't completed watching yet, the ones I am too watch soon etc.) Moreover at times, I get distracted from my
goal of watching a particular video due to the recommendations. 😅 This was the major inspiration for me behind building this project!<br>
Video, Channel information can directly searched using the API and moreover, a list is maintained of all the videos watched, yet to watch and watching right now.
More functionalities coming soon!😃

### Tools Used
